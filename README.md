Abstract 
Our project, the Face Scanner Attendance System, leverages advanced facial recognition technology to address the prevalent issue of proxy attendance in educational institutions. By implementing a three-tier attendance marking system—capturing entry, mid-session, and exit images—we ensure a comprehensive and accurate attendance record. The system, developed using Python, adds an extra layer of precision to attendance tracking, promoting fairness and accountability. 
 
1.	Introduction 
1.1	Background 
Traditional attendance systems often fall prey to loopholes, with students finding ways to manipulate attendance records. Proxy attendance undermines the integrity of the education system. To counter this, our Face Scanner Attendance System integrates cutting-edge facial recognition algorithms, providing a reliable and automated solution. The system not only simplifies the attendance process but also reduces the administrative burden on educational institutions. Our Face Scanner Attendance System not only targets the elimination of proxy attendance but also addresses the broader spectrum of attendance-related challenges, ensuring a more holistic and efficient solution. 
 
1.2	Problem Statement 
The prevalent issues of proxy attendance, late arrivals, early departures, and incomplete class attendance pose significant challenges to the effectiveness and fairness of traditional attendance tracking systems. Students exploiting these gaps create a distorted representation of their actual presence in the classroom, impacting their academic progress and the overall educational ecosystem. Our project seeks to rectify these problems by introducing a technologically advanced face scanner attendance system that comprehensively tackles unauthorized presence and incomplete attendance records. 
 
1.3	Objectives 
1.	Proxy Prevention: Develop a robust facial recognition system to eliminate proxy attendance, ensuring that only registered students can mark their presence. 
2.	Punctuality Enforcement: Incorporate features to mark attendance at the beginning, middle, and end of the class, discouraging late arrivals and early departures. 
3.	Comprehensive Attendance Tracking: Implement a three-tier attendance system to capture the entire duration of students' presence in class, promoting accountability for complete class attendance. 
4.	Automated Precision: Utilize Python for the automation of attendance processes, minimizing errors and reducing administrative burdens, thus creating a seamless and efficient system. 
5.	Enhance Accuracy: Implement a three-tier attendance marking system—entry, midsession, and exit—to ensure a more precise representation of students' presence throughout the class duration. 
6.	Improve Accountability: Foster a sense of responsibility among students by creating a system that not only marks attendance but also emphasizes the importance of being present throughout the entire class. 
 
By achieving these objectives, our Face Scanner Attendance System not only addresses the immediate concern of proxy attendance but also ensures a more disciplined and accountable student attendance culture, ultimately contributing to a more effective educational environment.
